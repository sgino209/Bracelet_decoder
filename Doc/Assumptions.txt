 The algo performs a valid decoding if the following conditions are met:

    1. Input image resolution shall be around 1600x1200
    2. Marks are in focus and not blurred
    3. Marks are the bracelet front
    4. Marks are in an "optimal" lightening, e.g. no shadowed areas

Notes:
(-) Assumption 1 shall be assured by the algo (auto-resize) --> next release
(-) Assumptions 2-3 are legitimate for a barcode-scanner app
(-) Assumption 4 shall be eliminated by enhancing the algo --> next release
